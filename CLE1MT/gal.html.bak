    <p>A rise in income and introduction of new job <br>
	opportunities beyond the agricultural sector led <br>
	to about two-third of decline in poverty.</p>

    <p>The South China Sea represents more than just <br>
	a geopolitical struggle; it is a hotspot for fishing.<br>
	Beijing claims that its historic rights give it <br>
	ownership inside the so-called Nine-Dash Line, <br>
	covering around 80 percent of the South China Sea.<br>
	These claims contradict maritime laws, among them <br>
	The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,<br>
	and have received backlash from several Southeast<br>
	Asian countries.</p>

    <p>As of 2015, 22 million Filipinos are still<br>
	living in the depths of poverty. That equates to <br>
	one-fifth of the population. Poverty presents <br>
	itself in a vicious cycle affecting mainly the <br>
	uneducated population who tend to live in large<br>
	family units. These family units usually have <br>
	only one head of the household who provides <br>
	income for the entire family.</p>

    <p>Amidst the 7,107 western Pacific islands <br>
	known as the Philippines, poverty is uniquely <br>
	endemic. A country of scattered landmass, the <br>
	Philippines is ranked the third most <br>
	disaster-prone country in the world, as its <br>
	close proximity to the equator encourages <br>
	destructive weather such as earthquakes and <br>
	storms. Natural disasters disproportionately <br>
	and recurrently hit the poorest regions of <br>
	the country, coursing them into higher <br>
	levels of poverty.</p>
